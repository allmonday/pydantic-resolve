"""Introspection support for the UseCase compose surface.

Two siblings:

- :func:`is_introspection_query` — cheap keyword-based detector used by
  ``compose_query`` to reject (or by HTTP handlers to route) ``__schema``
  / ``__type`` / ``__typename`` queries.
- :func:`compose_introspect` — hand-builds the GraphQL introspection
  response by walking the app's cached ``compose_schema`` registry.
  Returns the standard ``{data, errors}`` envelope. GraphiQL-compatible.

These live separately from :mod:`compose` because the execution pipeline
in ``compose.py`` handles *data* queries only; introspection is a
parallel path that callers must dispatch to explicitly.
