"""Schema-construction errors + shared scan for the entity GraphQL path.

All checks fire eagerly at scan time — inside ``GraphQLHandler.__init__``
when the grouped query/mutation maps are built, and (via the same
:func:`scan_grouped_methods` helper) when SDL is generated standalone
through ``SchemaBuilder.build_schema()`` — before any SDL or introspection
is produced, so a broken entity graph never silently drops or clobbers a
method.

Under the grouped layout the entity class name becomes both the root
Query/Mutation field name and the ``{Entity}Query`` / ``{Entity}Mutation``
type name, and the method name is used verbatim as the field on that group
type. That makes name collisions destructive (silently clobbering a group or
a method), so they are rejected up front instead of last-writer-wins.

Entity-name uniqueness (two distinct classes sharing ``__name__``) is
already enforced by ``ErDiagram._validate_configs`` at construction time, so
it is not re-checked here.
